# Student Teacher Collections Daily Project

Purpose of the assignment is to create collections of students and teachers using List, Set and Map.<br>

# Assignment

Create a Student JavaBean (empty constructor and getters and setters)<br>

firstName<br>
lastName<br>
id<br>
grade<br>
In the main() method of Main create an ArrayList of 15 students which represents all the 1st grade students at an elementary school. Make sure the ids are unique and set the grade to 1.<br>

Generate equals(), hashCode() and toString() using IntelliJ. Re-write equals() and hashCode() to use the id variable.<br>

The Teacher class is the same as the Student class (Hint: you could use this fact to save yourself some time) Teacher<br>

firstName<br>
lastName<br>
id<br>
grade<br>

Instantiate 3 Teachers just like you did for Students and add to an ArrayList of teachers.<br>

Code a HashMap that takes a Teacher for a key and a Set of students for the value (not a List of students). Each Teacher will have 5 different students in a HashSet.<br>

Print out the map keys in a for loop (use the keySet() method). Print out the map values in a for loop (use the values() method).<br>

# Extras

Print out the map entries in a for loop (use the entrySet() method).
